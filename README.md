I am *Scott Booma*

Born April, 27 1994

My favorite book is *Hell's Angels* by Hunter S. Thompson

Favorite movie is probably *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas*

Favorite band is the Grateful Dead though I really do enjoy most all jam bands.

Favroite food is a nice big juicy burger right off the grill (gotta be charcoal).

Favorite past-time is camping and spending time with my wife in the mountains.
